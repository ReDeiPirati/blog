          "content": "Hi 👋, I’m Alessio, your friendly neighborhood pirate 🏴‍☠️. I’m currently working as Product Manager at FloydHub (YC W2017) 1, where I’ve helped thousands of developers and companies to build &amp; train AI (i.e. machine and deep learning) models. . Previously, I failed as a startup founder. That’s a good, but hard for me to tell, story that I’ll certainly post on the blog in the future. Stay tuned! . I have a great passion for technology and startups. If you share my same interests, you will feel at home! . I’m a proud labrador &amp; german shepherd dad, the mom is a DVM 😁. . Want to hire me? . I’m committed to simplify and optimize the relationship between humans and machines because I dream of a world more safe, accessible, and fair if technology will be developed with the right processes and approaches (e.g. human-centered design). . I’m the type of person who is looking for a place where I can have an impact and trigger the success of the people around me. I love challenges: the harder, the better. . If you think that my career goal aligns with your mission and that I can be a good fit for your team, feel free to reach me out (see social buttons at the very bottom or drop me an email). . FloydHub (YC W17) is Heroku for deep learning. A Platform-as-a-Service for training and deploying your deep learning models in the cloud. Floyd takes care of the engineering grunt work so you can focus on the core of your problem. &#8617; . |",
