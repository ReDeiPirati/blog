Athlete . I was an athlete, I know what it means to work hard for short, middle, and long-term goals, and how to self-motivate myself and a team even when things are not doing great. .

Floyd takes care of the engineering grunt work so you can focus on the core of your problem. . Product Management . At FloydHub we were extremely customer-obsessed, and I‚Äôm particularly proud of the experience I helped to create. . FloydHub has released an integrated developer environment for deep learning, based on Jupyter. Looks very nice! I like how user-focused FloydHub seems to be. https://t.co/BZQiZldPKx pic.twitter.com/1tNO1BZ393 . &mdash; Fran√ßois Chollet (@fchollet) June 6, 2018 My key responsibility was to smooth the experience for our target customer, in a way that they‚Äôve never had to fight against the platform, unlike other cloud services like AWS and GCP where you will face a steep learning curve. I positioned myself between customer support &amp; customer success, IMHO the best place to close the feedback-loop about the next thing to build, and where I could aggregate data on different layers. I created this framework internally called Product Improvement Engine 1 , a ranking system for the backlog based on the data aggregated from support tickets, customer development insights, and usability test videos to create weekly reports that I shared and discussed with the CTO in order to plan the roadmaps for each sprint. . I was responsible to create the items for the backlog that came from the data collected from customers and to envision &amp; prototype a possible UX with Balsamiq, Sketch App, and other tools for the next features to build or suboptimal experience to fix. . E.g. of features that I successfully deployed are: FloydHub‚Äôs In-App notifications, improved UX of developer tool when mounting and uploading data - floyd-cli. . . Customer Support . I made the experience as effortless as possible, and provided technical support on the Forum, Intercom, and Zendesk for almost 3 years, you can find all my posts &amp; activities, here: . FloydHub Forum, | FloydHub Help Center / Knowledge Base, | FloydHub Docs | . I helped thousand of developers and companies building &amp; training AI models üöÄ. . Content Marketing . Everything published on the FloydHub blog after March 2019 was planned, structured, revisioned, and co-edited by me. I set up and refined several processes, hired up to 20 technical writers &amp; 2 editors. You can also find my contributions, here. . I mainly focused our distribution on HackerNews: we got the front with 14 articles over 27 released. I cannot say to have reverse-engineered HN and its audience, but I was probably just a few steps away, not to mention that being a YC company in an extremely hyped field certainly matters. It happened a couple of times that we published a new article and a few minutes later it was already on HN with 4/5 upvotes, that was something that made me proud of the work I did. . Although I focused my efforts on HN, the articles were crafted to capture organic searches and get ranked on the 1st page of Google for the keywords of interest in the middle-term(2-3 months). HN was my leverage to speed up that process and at the same time increase our web presence. . Despite the time &amp; resource constraints I had, I was able to coach &amp; help the recurring writers to progress in their careers: Ajay has written a chapter for a new O‚ÄôReilly NLP book, Cathal transitioned from SWE to MLE at Intercom, Sayak increased his web presence &amp; gave a lot of talks around the world with the content he created with us, and Philip has released a book Writing for Software Developers. All those guys were already great when I met them for the first time, and with my work, I helped them to increase the self-confidence in their skills and get the exposure they deserved. . I‚Äôm planning to bring this on the blog in the near future.¬†&#8617; . |",
