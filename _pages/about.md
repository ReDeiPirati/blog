Hi 👋, I'm Alessio, your friendly neighborhood pirate 🏴‍☠️. I'm currently working as Product Manager at [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) (YC W2017) [^1] and co-founder at [Floyd Labs - FloydHub's AI tactical consulting](https://www.floydlabs.ai/), where I've helped thousand of developers and companies to build & train AI (i.e. machine and deep learning) models.

Previously, I failed as a startup founder. That's a good, but hard for me to tell, story that I'll certainly post on the blog in the future. Stay tuned!

I have a great passion for technology and startups. If you share my same interest, you are in the right place.

I'm a proud labrador & german shepherd dad, the mom is my soulmate and DVM 😁.  

### Self-Taught Education

I'm a long-life learner commited in the continuing education and sharing knowledge manifesto. Self-taught education is certainly the future, most of the best talents I had the luck to work with are self-taught, [here's a living proof](https://blog.floydhub.com/emils-story-as-a-self-taught-ai-researcher/).

Here are the highlights:

- Learned Entrepreneurship from [Y-Combinator](https://www.startupschool.org/) and startup experience.
- Learned Content Marketing, Customer Support & Business Development from startup experience.
- Coursera Certificate: [Machine Learning](https://blog.floydhub.com/best-deep-learning-courses-updated-for-2019/#ml) and [Deep Learning](https://blog.floydhub.com/best-deep-learning-courses-updated-for-2019/#deep-learning-specialization) (Andrew Ng courses), Cryptography I.
- Learned AI/ML/RL/DL/DRL from Coursera, Udacity, EdX, Blogs, Books, Youtube, ArXiv, and Github.
- Learned PWA and web development best practices from Google Web Developers and Udacity Course.
- Learned Kubernetes, Docker, Swarm, CI/CD, TDD, SOA, MicroServices, and Serverless Architecture
from Victor Farcic books, [podcast](https://www.devopsparadox.com/) and [blog post](https://technologyconversations.com/).
- Learned Pentesting & Cyber Security from [Offensive Security courses](https://www.offensive-security.com/), CTF, [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/), books and [OWASP](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page).
- Still studying Game Theory, [Human & Animal Biology Behaviour](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D) and System Design to understand how intelligent system work & cooperate in complex systems.

### Education

I gratuaded 🎓 in Computer Science at Bologna University. Here are the highlights:
- Took courses on Algorithms & Data Structures, Linear Algebra, Statistic, and Numerical Calculus.
- Developed uArm: a micro Kernel (toy OS) that runs on an Arm Emulator (Operative System project Assignment).
- Developed Annotaria: a web application to make semantic annotations on medical papers (Web Technology project Assignment).
- Developed a Meta Search Engine to find food recipes named Cookgle during the last year of University (developed as assignment project of Databases, Mobile App. and Web Technology).
- Experimented different software development approaches (Linear, Waterfall, Agile, Extreme Programming, Scrum and Kanban) and design patterns.

### Athlete

I was an athlete, I know what it means to work hard for short, middle and long-term goals. 

- Swimmer 🏊‍♂️ (age 10-24), I was in the Italian Top 10 rank in 50m freestyle (got also Europian Top 10 rank in the past) and 100m fly for about ten years - class 1991. During the last 3 years of my career, I was trained by one of the best Italian swimming coaches in a team with 5 Olympic athletes. I achieved outstanding results given my expectations.
- I also practiced Thriathlon (🏊‍♂️,🚴‍♂️, and 🏃‍♂️), Modern Pentathlon (🏊‍♂️, 🏃‍♂️, 🤺, 🔫, and 🏇) and Soccer (🦵⚽️) at age 7-10.


## Want to hire me?

I’m committed to simplify and optimize the relationship between humans and machines because I dream of a world more safe, accessible, and fair if technology will be developed with the right processes and approaches (e.g. human-centered design). 

I'm the type of person who is looking for a place where I can have an impact and trigger the success of the people around. I love challenges: the harder, the better.

If you think that my career goal aligns with your mission and that I can be good fit for your team, feel free to reach me out (see social buttons at the very bottom).
