Hi üëã, I'm Alessio, your friendly neighborhood pirate üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è and future King of Pirates. I'm currently working as Product Manager at [FloydHub](https://www.floydhub.com/) (YC W2017) [^1] and co-founder at [Floyd Labs - FloydHub's AI tactical consulting](https://www.floydlabs.ai/), where I've helped thousands of developers and companies to build & train AI (i.e. machine and deep learning) models.

Previously, I failed as a startup founder. That's a good, but hard for me to tell, story that I'll certainly post on the blog in the future. Stay tuned!

I have a great passion for technology and startups. If you share my same interests, you will feel at home!

I'm a proud labrador & german shepherd dad, the mom is a DVM üòÅ.

## Want to hire me?

I‚Äôm committed to simplify and optimize the relationship between humans and machines because I dream of a world more safe, accessible, and fair if technology will be developed with the right processes and approaches (e.g. human-centered design). 

I'm the type of person who is looking for a place where I can have an impact and trigger the success of the people around me. I love challenges: the harder, the better.

If you think that my career goal aligns with your mission and that I can be a good fit for your team, feel free to reach me out (see social buttons at the very bottom or drop me an email).
