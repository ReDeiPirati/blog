## FloydHub

### Product Management

At FloydHub we were extremely customer-obsessed, and I'm particularly proud of the experience I helped to create.

My key responsibility was to smooth the experience for our target customer, in a way that they've never had to fight against the platform, unlike other cloud services like AWS and GCP where you will face a steep learning curve. I positioned myself between customer support & customer success, IMHO the best place to close the feedback-loop about the next thing to build, and where I could aggregate data on different layers. I created this framework internally called Product Improvement Engine [^1] , a ranking system for the backlog based on the data aggregated from support tickets, customer development insights, and usability test videos to create weekly reports that I shared and discussed with the CTO in order to plan the roadmaps for each sprint. 

I was responsible to create the items for the backlog that came from the data collected from customers and to envision & prototype a possible UX with Balsamiq, Sketch App, and other tools for the next features to build or suboptimal experience to fix.

E.g. of features that I successfully deployed are: FloydHubâ€™s In-App notifications, improved UX of developer tool when mounting and uploading data - [floyd-cli](https://github.com/floydhub/floyd-cli).


### Customer Support

I made the experience as effortless as possible, and provided technical support on the Forum, Intercom, and Zendesk for almost 3 years, you can find all my posts & activities, here: 

- [FloydHub Forum](https://forum.floydhub.com/users/redeipirati/summary),
- [FloydHub Help Center / Knowledge Base](https://help.floydhub.com/en/),
- [FloydHub Docs](https://docs.floydhub.com/)

I helped thousand of developers and companies building & training AI models ðŸš€.


### Content Marketing

Everything published on the [FloydHub blog](https://blog.floydhub.com) after March 2019 was planned, structured, revisioned, and co-edited by me. You can also find my contributions, [here](https://blog.floydhub.com/author/alessio/).

I mainly focused our distribution on HackerNews: we got the front with 14 articles over 27 released. I cannot say to have reverse-engineered HN and its audience, but I was probably just a few steps away, not to mention that being a YC company in an extremely hyped field certainly matters. It happened a couple of times that we published a new article and a few minutes later it was already on HN with 4/5 upvotes, that was something that made me proud of the work I did.

Although I focused my efforts on HN, the articles were crafted to capture organic searches and get ranked on the 1st page of Google for the keywords of interest in the middle-term(2-3 months). HN was my leverage to speed up that process and at the same time increase our web presence.

Despite the time & resource constraints I had, I was able to coach & help the recurring writers to progress in their careers: Ajay has written a chapter for a new Oâ€™Reilly NLP book, Cathal transitioned from SWE to MLE at Intercom, Sayak increased his web presence & gave a lot of talks around the world with the content he created with us, and Philip has released a book Writing for Software Developers. All those guys were already great when I met them for the first time, and with my work, I helped them to increase the self-confidence in their skills and get the exposure they deserved.
