Welcome to Alessio Gozzoli's blog, the place where pirates (i.e. present and future startups founders),  technology enthusiasts and visionaries can find useful information, advice, insights, resources, and inspiration for starting, running and growing their startup. Or some help to fail faster...  

_Embrace failures, those are the trigger for your success._

Frequency: I aim to publish an article per month.
