Welcome to Alessio Gozzoli's blog, the place where pirates (i.e. past, present, and future startups founders) can find useful information, advice, insights, resources, and inspiration for starting, running and growing their startups. Or some help to fail faster! This is a place where Product Managers can find something useful too.   

> Embrace failures, those are the trigger for your success.

Frequency: I aim to publish an article per month. _What if do I miss a deadline?_ In this case, reach me out and say something "preferably" nice, or tell me about something that you would like to read from me.
